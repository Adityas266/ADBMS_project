                W ter quality refers to the chemical, physical, and biological characteristics of water based on the
                standards of its usage. It is most frequently used by reference to a set of standards against which
                compliance, generally achieved through treatment of the water, can be assessed. The most common
                standards used to monitor and assess water quality convey the health of ecosystems, safety of human
                contact, extend of water pollution and condition of drinking water. Water quality has a significant
                impact on water supply and oftentimes determines supply options.
